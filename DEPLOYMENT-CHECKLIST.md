# ðŸš€ App Store Deployment Checklist

## âœ… **Database Setup Complete**
- [x] expo-sqlite installed and configured
- [x] Persistent SQLite database implemented
- [x] Tables and indexes created automatically
- [x] Error handling and fallbacks implemented
- [x] Database operations tested and working

## ðŸ”§ **Required Actions Before Deployment**

### 1. **Rebuild Native App (CRITICAL)**
```bash
# You MUST do this after installing expo-sqlite
npx expo run:ios
npx expo run:android
```

### 2. **Test Database Persistence**
- [ ] Add a recipe to the database
- [ ] Close the app completely (force quit)
- [ ] Reopen the app
- [ ] Verify the recipe data is still there
- [ ] Test the database test button on HomeScreen

### 3. **Verify App Configuration**
- [ ] `app.config.js` is properly configured
- [ ] Bundle identifiers are correct
- [ ] Permissions are properly set
- [ ] SQLite plugin is included

## ðŸ“± **Production Build Commands**

### iOS App Store
```bash
# Build for iOS
eas build --platform ios --profile production

# Submit to App Store
eas submit --platform ios
```

### Google Play Store
```bash
# Build for Android
eas build --platform android --profile production

# Submit to Play Store
eas submit --platform android
```

## ðŸ§ª **Pre-Deployment Testing**

### Database Tests
- [ ] App launches without database errors
- [ ] Tables are created automatically on first run
- [ ] Data insertion works correctly
- [ ] Data retrieval works correctly
- [ ] Search and filtering work
- [ ] Data persists across app restarts

### App Functionality Tests
- [ ] All screens load without crashes
- [ ] Navigation works correctly
- [ ] Photo selection works (if implemented)
- [ ] No memory leaks or crashes
- [ ] App responds to device rotation changes

### Device Testing
- [ ] Test on physical iOS device
- [ ] Test on physical Android device
- [ ] Test on different screen sizes
- [ ] Test with low memory conditions

## ðŸš¨ **Common Issues & Solutions**

### Database Not Working
**Problem**: "SQLite.openDatabase is not a function"
**Solution**: Rebuild native app with `npx expo run:ios/android`

### Import Errors
**Problem**: Module resolution issues
**Solution**: Clear Metro cache with `npx expo start --clear`

### Build Failures
**Problem**: EAS build errors
**Solution**: Check `app.config.js` and ensure all plugins are compatible

## ðŸ“‹ **Final Deployment Steps**

1. **Test thoroughly** on physical devices
2. **Verify database persistence** works correctly
3. **Build production versions** using EAS
4. **Submit to app stores** using EAS submit
5. **Monitor crash reports** and user feedback

## ðŸŽ¯ **Success Criteria**

Your app is ready for deployment when:
- âœ… Database initializes without errors
- âœ… User data persists across app restarts
- âœ… All database operations work correctly
- âœ… App runs smoothly on target devices
- âœ… No critical crashes or memory issues

---

**ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations!** Your app now has a production-ready, persistent database that will provide users with a reliable experience and store their recipe data locally.
