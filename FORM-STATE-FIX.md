# Form State Persistence Fix

## Problem Solved

The app was experiencing the classic "form screen gets rebuilt, callback gets lost, fields reset" problem when navigating between the **Add Tasting** form and the **Stock Photo Picker**.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Zustand Store for Draft State

Created `src/state/useDraftTasting.js` - a lightweight global store that persists form data across screen navigations.

**Key Features:**
- All form fields (title, brand, category, rating, notes, photo, dateTried)
- Simple actions: `setField()`, `setPhoto()`, `reset()`
- No provider boilerplate needed
- Survives screen remounts and hot reloads

### 2. Updated NewTastingScreen

- Replaced local `useState` with Zustand store selectors
- Removed complex `useFocusEffect` logic
- Form now reads from and writes to the global store
- No more callback-based photo selection

### 3. Updated StockPickerScreen

- Removed callback-based photo selection
- Now directly updates the draft store with `setPhoto()`
- Simple `navigation.goBack()` after selection
- No more complex param passing or callback management

### 4. Navigation Configuration

The `AddTasting` screen already had `unmountOnBlur: false` set, which helps keep the component mounted during navigation.

## How to Test

### Test Flow:

1. **Open Add Tasting form**
2. **Fill in some fields:**
   - Type a title (e.g., "Honeycrisp Apple")
   - Set a brand (e.g., "Trader Joe's")
   - Select a category
   - Set a rating (e.g., 4 stars)
   - Add some notes
3. **Tap "Stock Photo"**
4. **Select a photo and tap "Use selected photo"**
5. **Verify you return to the same form with:**
   - All fields intact (title, brand, category, rating, notes)
   - Selected photo visible
6. **Tap "Save"** - should work normally

### Expected Behavior:

✅ **Form fields persist** - No data loss when navigating to picker and back  
✅ **Photo selection works** - Selected photo appears in form  
✅ **Save works normally** - Form saves and resets properly  
✅ **No callback errors** - No more "function not found" issues  
✅ **Hot reload safe** - State survives development reloads  

## Technical Benefits

1. **No serialization issues** - No functions in navigation params
2. **No callback management** - Direct store updates
3. **Survives remounts** - State persists even if screen unmounts
4. **Easy to extend** - Add more fields or features easily
5. **Development friendly** - Works with hot reload

## Files Changed

- `src/state/useDraftTasting.js` - New Zustand store
- `src/screens/NewTastingScreen.js` - Updated to use store
- `src/screens/StockPickerScreen.js` - Updated to use store
- `package.json` - Added Zustand dependency

## Dependencies Added

- `zustand@5.0.8` - Lightweight state management

This solution follows React Navigation best practices and eliminates the brittle callback-based approach in favor of a robust global state solution.
